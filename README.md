# userscript_ip_location
A userscript that shows public IP (IPv4 or IPv6) in a movable dialog box.

AUTO_UPDATE and UPDATE_TIME(ms) are configurable at the top of script. Default is update every 10 seconds.

CAUTION: Setting auto-update too low will get rate-throttled. Redundant API's are built in as backups but they can be maxed out as well.
